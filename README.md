# Kindergarten - Django School Management System (Scaffold)

This repository is a scaffold generated by ChatGPT. It contains the file structure and starter code for a Django-based school management system.

## How to use

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
2. Set `SECRET_KEY` and other env vars (or edit `kindergarten_project/settings.py` for quick dev).
3. Run `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate`.
4. Create a superuser with `python manage.py createsuperuser`.
5. Run the dev server: `python manage.py runserver`.

## Notes
- Payment integrations (Bkash/Nagad) are mocked; implement provider SDK/webhooks for production.
- Adjust `settings.py` for production (DEBUG=False, allowed hosts, PostgreSQL, email backend, static files).
